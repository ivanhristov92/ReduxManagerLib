# What is ReduxManagerLib?

ReduxManagerLib is a runtime **generator of CRUD-ready data models** for **Redux**.


***

It creates all of the **Redux piping** necessary **to start working** **with** a given model very **quickly**. On top of that it provides a piece of mind, because it is **predictable and easy to follow**, and gives meaningful feedback.


***

_ReduxManagerLib can be used with any Redux app, regardless of the view library of choice._
