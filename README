What is ReduxManagerLib?
ReduxManagerLib is a runtime generator of CRUD-ready data models for Redux.

It creates all of the Redux piping necessary to start working with a given model very quickly. On top of that it provides a piece of mind, because it is predictable and easy to follow, and gives meaningful feedback.

ReduxManagerLib can be used with any Redux app, regardless of the view library of choice.
